# Rayquaza-Sounding-Rocket
 thrustMIT’s fourth attempt at the Spaceport America Cup features Rayquaza, a rocket
 designed to reach an apogee of 10,000 feet with a functioning non-deployable payload, and
 completely recoverable byareefedparachute. PoweredbyCesaroni’sCommercial-Off-The-Shelf
 solid-propellant Pro98 M3400-P, the rocket shall be carrying a payload investigating the effects
 of launch vehicle vibrations on Carbon Fibre Reinforced Polymer. The flight computer combines
 a Commercial-Off-The-Shelf system and a Student Researched And Developed system. The
 apogee detection system is one unique characteristic of the launch vehicle. The rocket features a
 carbon fibre composite fuselage and Aluminium 6063 bulkheads, centring rings, stringers, fins
 and thrust plate for added structural strength. The team was conceived in early 2016 to nurture
 rocketry as a hobby in India, and by competing at the Spaceport America Cup, the team will get
 a platform to share its knowledge and learn from fellow students from all around the world.
